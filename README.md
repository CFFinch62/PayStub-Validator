# PayStub-Validator

I created a console program to help my wife validate her paystub information as she was concerbned about mistakes being made. 
It worked very well so I made this GUI version for her to give to her co-employees to try. 
It is mostly finihsed. However, it does not follow all the timesheet and pay rules for her work exactly. 
I though it could be a good jumping off point for orhers to make it work for them or create a simple payroll system.
It is currently desinged for a single employee but it could be easily changed to handle multiple employees.


Review the wage and time rules to be adjusted as you need.
Edit employee JSON file for your use. 
Enter a timehseet and generate a paystub.
